This is my first platformer in Godot! I have tried many unsuccesful attempts to make a godot game but all have failed so I decided to start low and started with the most basic yet unique 2D platformer!

Controls:
  W/space/keyUp --- Jump
  A/keyLeft --- Left
  D/keyRight --- Right
  E --- press this key with jump to jump higher or press it while moving to dash
